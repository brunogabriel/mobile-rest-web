# Web Restful API

Hello welcome to this repository! Iâ€™m creating to help developers to code your own restful api. Restful it's generally used to communicate with mobile applications or web applications.

## Getting Started

**I strongly recommend** to use virtualenv, but if you don't want to use, fell free. 

**Observation: I commit my migrations, but if you want to delete, fell free too.**

SQLite connection **admin**:

	user: root
	password: root123456
	
## Prerequisities

Basically, all prerequisities will be found in requirements.txt (libraries of application), the source uses Python 2 (by default, in Linux and OSX).

## Installing

Now, let's go to run

* Install requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* Execute migrate/migrations:

```bash
python manage makemigrations
python manage migrate
```

* Run project locally:

```bash
python manage runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```

## How this project will work?

It's simple to understand how to use this project in base to create your own restful api's. Below, a list of explanations:

1. Inside **`urls.py`**, we've a reference to routes. Has two files named `urls.py` and our routes references `views`.

2. **`Views`** will return a result from Rest API by using a `form`.

3. **`Forms`** basically contains all the parameters with business rules and mission to validate all of them.

4. **`Serializers`** contains the fields returned by this API.

## SQLite Database

Inside the database file (db.sqlite3), has some examples of NBA Teams (thank you [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/) and [Fox Sports](http://www.foxsports.com/)), that I used only for studies, feel free to change it.

## RESTFUL API

At the moment, only **POST** method is used to this API:

1. **`do_create_account`** (api/user/createaccount): This method will create an user account, remember that users have only a token, when user executed a login, it's necessary to use this token to get results from api (list teams). Parameters:
	+ firstname (required), type: string
	+ lastname (required), type: string
	+ email (required), type: string
	+ password (required), type: string

2. **`do_login`** (api/user/login): Execute a login return user data and token. Parameters:
	+ username (required), type: string
	+ platform type: string, valid values: ios, and and wph
	+ password (required), type: string
	+ device_identifier, type: string
```json
{
  "message": "Success to login.",
  "user": {
    "id": 4,
    "username": "brunogabriel",
    "first_name": "Bruno Gabriel",
    "last_name": "Santos",
    "email": "bruno.gsantos89@gmail.com",
    "token": "d7f8cc0ac7a56868a153e140f0a6a23351d318f7"
  },
  "success": true
}
```

3. **`list_teams`** (api/teams/list): Will return a list of NBA teams by starting in init position until sum of init plus threshould. Parameters:
	+ username (required), type: string
	+ token (required), type: string
	+ init, type: int (default = 0)
	+ threshould, type: int (default = 10)

```json
{
  "message": "Success on list teams",
  "success": true,
  "teams": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Boston Celtics",
      "conference": "EC",
      "arena": "TD Garden",
      "foundation": "1946-06-06",
      "about_history": "The Boston Celtics ...",
      "flag": "http://www.foxsports.com/content/dam/fsdigital/fscom/global/dev/static_resources/nba/teams/retina/2.png"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "Brooklyn Nets",
      "conference": "EC",
      "arena": "Barclays Center",
      "foundation": "1967-01-01",

    }
  ]
}

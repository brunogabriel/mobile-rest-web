# Web Restful API

Hello welcome to this repository! Iâ€™m creating to help developers to code your own restful api. Restful it's generally used to communicate with mobile applications or web applications.

## Getting Started

**I strongly recommend** to use virtualenv, but if you don't want to use, fell free. 

**Observation: I commit my migrations, but if you want to delete, fell free too.**

SQLite connection **admin**:

	user: root
	password: root123456
	
## Prerequisities

Basically, all prerequisities will be found in requirements.txt (libraries of application), the source uses Python 2 (by default, in Linux and OSX).

## Installing

Now, let's go to run

* Install requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* Execute migrate/migrations:

```bash
python manage makemigrations
python manage migrate
```

* Run project locally:

```bash
python manage runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```

## How this project will work?

It's simple to understand how to use this project in base to create your own restful api's. Below, a list of explanations:

1. Inside **`urls.py`**, we've a reference to routes. Has two files named `urls.py` and our routes references `views`.

2. **`Views`** will return a result from Rest API by using a `form`.

3. **`Forms`** basically contains all the parameters with business rules and mission to validate all of them.

4. **`Serializers`** contains the fields returned by this API.
